# Unit 20 - "Looks like we've made our First Contract!"

## Solidity-homework
This repository contains Solidity code for three smart contracts that handle compensation distribution in one of three ways:

Associate Profit Splitter - splits total compensation distribution between all employees equally
Tiered Profit Splitter - splits total compensations distribution between employees differently based on role
Deferred Equity Plan - distrbutes an equal number of shares to an employee over four years

This should be run over the Kovan Ethereum testnet.
